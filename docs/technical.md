# Technical requirements for the workshop

* If you have an Office 365 account you can use any computer or mobile device, to some extent, as it is possible to use Word 365 online to complete many aspects of the workshop.
* You will have a better experience if you are running Windows and Microsoft Word 365 (or Windows 10 and Word 2016)
* If you have admin permissions you may wish to install and use [Central Access Reader](https://www.cwu.edu/central-access/reader) but this is not required
