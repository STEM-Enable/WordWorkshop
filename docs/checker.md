# Using Word Accessibility Checker for basic tests

Microsoft Word provides an accessibility checker. This is a good start and will highlight some issues. In some cases it will suggest an appropriate fix. I usually run this first and last when checking a document. 

Use either by pressing **Alt+R** then **A** then **1** or: 

1. In the ribbon, click on the **Review tab**
2. Click on **Check Accessibility**

The results will appear in the right-hand document pane. Click on each error to get more information and to see the steps you should take to fix the error. Donâ€™t fix these yet though! 

## Consider or discuss

* Do you think these are all the issues with the document? 
* Do you think the recommended fixes are appropriate?
