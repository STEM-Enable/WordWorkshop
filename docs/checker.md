# Using Word Accessibility Checker for basic tests

You can run the accessibility checker either by pressing **alt+r** then **a** then **1** or: 

1. In the ribbon, click on the Review tab
2. Click on Check Accessibility

The results will appear in the right-hand document pane. Click on each error to get more information and to see the steps you should take to fix the error. Donâ€™t fix these yet though! 

## Discuss

* Do you think that these are all the issues with the document? 
* Do you think the recommended fixes are appropriate?
