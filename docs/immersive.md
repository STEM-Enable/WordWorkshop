# Using Word 365 Learning Tools (Immersive) for basic tests

If you have access to Word 365, either on your computer or via a (non-mobile) browser you can do a basic test of accessibility of mathematics using the immersive learning tools. Any maths that is not appropriately read aloud is not accessible.

To use this tool:
1. In the ribbon click on View
2. Click on navigation
3. Click on Learning Tools (Immersive)
4. Increase the zoom
5. Put the cursor in the document and click on read aloud

## Discuss

* What additional issues have you found with the document?
* Do you know what is causing them?
