# Using Word 365 Learning Tools (Immersive) for basic tests

If you have access to Word 365, either on your computer or via a (non-mobile) browser you can do a basic test of accessibility of mathematics using the immersive learning tools. Any maths that is not appropriately read aloud is not accessible.

To use this tool:
1. In the ribbon click on **View**
2. Click on navigation to open the navigation pane. This will show the heading structure of the document. 
3. Click on Learning Tools (Immersive)
4. Increase the text size, change the colours etc. and have a look at the result.
5. Put the cursor in the document and click on read aloud and/or the play button (depends on version).

## Consider or discuss

* What additional issues have you found with the document?
* Do you know what is causing them? Can you fix them?
