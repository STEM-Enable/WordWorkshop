# Central Access Reader

It is common for students with dyslexia, other SpLDs or with conditions which impact concentration (including mental health, pain and fatigue conditions) to be recommended literacy support software which includes text-to-speech capabilities. The most commonly supplied softwares received through the Disabled Students Allowance (DSA) for this purpose are:

* TextHelp Read&Write
* ClaroRead

As of 3rd September 2019 the above pieces of software could not read aloud equations in Word. TextHelp Read&Write can read aloud accessible mathematical text on websites. ClaroRead has no capabilities for reading any mathematical text.

It is a good idea to make students aware of the above and to suggest that they either use Word 365 or Central Access Reader (CAR) instead. **CAR is free**. 

## Testing the document using CAR

1. Download the document and run CAR
2. Click on the plus symbol and select the document
3. Increase the font size
4. Click play to read aloud

## Discuss

* What additional issues have you found with the document?
* Do you know what is causing them?

# CAR can be used to create alternative formats

CAR is not screenreader accessible but it can be used to create alternative formats for screenreader users whose screenreader does not, as yet, work with Word equations. To do this:

1. Click on the Save to MP3 button.
2. Select the HTML Flex export option. 
3. Provide the output files to the student (learning how to use these is outside the scope of this workshop).

These files will also be accessible to virtually all screenreaders (either natively or via the MathJax fallback) and to TextHelp Read&Write.
