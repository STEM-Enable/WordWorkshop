# What to do if you aren't sure

## General accessibility

* Use the [accessibility checker](checker.html) but consider whether the fixes are appropriate for the content before taking action
 * After this workshop you might watch and refer to videos produced by Microsoft to help with this
 * Writing alternative text for scientific images is not an easy task. [Benetech are the leader in providing advice on writing alt text for science](http://diagramcenter.org/) however you might also consider whether it is more appropriate to link to an alternative method of interaction which is accessible e.g. [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/accessibility)

### Use styles

Every part of your document should be styled. This helps with navigation which is, arguably, more important in a mathematical document. Why? When we read mathematics we move backwards and forwards checking things far more than when reading other text.

### Don't add whitespace

THING THING THING

## Mathematical text

**All** mathematical text should be written using the Office equation editor. For instance, if you are writing about the variable \(x\) it should be written as an equation. If you are writing \(x^2\) it should be written as an equation.

* Never use insert symbol.
* Never use the sub and super script buttons in the Word ribbon.
* Never use an image of an equation.

### Remind me of why I need to follow these rules?

This enables assistive technology which can interact directly with equations in Word to work properly. It also ensures that automatic conversion is possible, using the structural integrity, to other formats which are accessible by other assistive technology. For a full overview of the current situation see the [table which tells us which AT works with which formats]().

If you find inputting equations slow in Word (click, click, click) then you can type them! Help on doing that:
* [Getting started with effective entry of equations in Word](http://www.mathcentre.ac.uk/bathmash/Word/index.html)
* If you usually use [MathType]() then you may wish to make a change. You can now type in Word equation editor **and** while MathType equations are accessible to some assistive technology they are not accessible to all. It is an automatic transform to got from Word equation format to MathType but there is no quick way to undo this operation. Hence you should author in Word equation editor and check that a copy converts using MathType.
