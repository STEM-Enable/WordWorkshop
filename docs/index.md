4. **Part 2 in pairs/groups:** [Use tools to find issues in this document](https://github.com/STEM-Enable/WordWorkshop/raw/master/examples/Inaccessible%20Word%20Document.docx)

5. **Part 3:** [Get started fixing an inaccessible document or creating an accessible one!](https://github.com/STEM-Enable/WordWorkshop/raw/master/examples/Inaccessible%20Word%20Document.docx)
   * [Summary of your basic aims](hints.html)
     * You might have a document you want to fix
     * Or you might want to start writing a document and test what you do
     * Or come up with your own fix of the inaccessible document linked above 
   * **Discussion: What three things will you do differently from now on?**
