## Using Word Accessibility Checker for basic tests

You can run the accessibility checker either by pressing **alt+r** then **a** then **1** or: 

1. In the ribbon, click on the Review tab
2. Click on Check Accessibility

The results will appear in the right-hand document pane. Click on each error to get more information and to see the steps you should take to fix the error. Donâ€™t fix these yet though! 

### Discuss

* Do you think that these are all the issues with the document? 
* Do you think the recommended fixes are appropriate?

## Using Word 365 Learning Tools (Immersive) for basic tests

## Using Central Access Reader for basic tests

## Using Windows Narrator (screenreader) for basic tests

Please note that these are instructions are not intended to teach you how to use a screenreader and they are not suitable for someone who usually uses a screenreader. Please also note that students will certainly have a screenreader more suited to education and employment than Narrator. These instructions exist solely to aid lecturers or teaching fellows in understanding how the structure of a Word document is used by a screenreader.

1. Open the Word document you want to explore and click your cursor at the start.
2. Remember earphones if in public!
3. Press **Windows key + Ctrl + Enter** to start Narrator.
   * To stop Narrator from finishing the current output press **Ctrl**
   * To stop Narrator completely press **Windows key + Ctrl + Enter**
4. Narrator has a mode which is mainly for scanning through and reading. We are only going to use this mode as it is easy for an untrained user to use with a Word document. You cannot edit the document when in this mode. 
   * To get in or out of scan mode press **CapsLock + Spacebar**
   * More information at <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22809/windows-10-narrator-using-scan-mode> 
5. Try not to use the mouse! Once in scan mode use the below commands to explore the document.
