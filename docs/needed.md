# What makes a mathematical document accessible?

## Key points

* It is possible to make an accessible mathematical document in Word but the system does not enforce it
* Many mathematical documents created are not accessible because they have inadequate structure
* Documents may also be inaccessible due to the lack of appropriate alternative methods of interacting with the material

## Inadequate structure

A document has inadequate structure if it is not possible for software to distinguish parts of the document and the links between those parts. For example, a document may have inadequate structure if an author has created headings by making the text larger and bold. Visually these look like headings but it is not possible for a computer to recognise this text conclusively as a heading. This is a general example, not specific to mathematics.

A mathematical document may, in addition, have inadequate structure because the way the mathematical content has been input is inappropriate.

* [Microsoft Word, and many other methods of encoding mathematical content do not enforce adequate structure](http://stemenable.referata.com/wiki/Inadequate_structure)

## Structural integrity

A document has structural integrity if each component within it retains the structure originally given to it by the author even when transformed to another format or interacted with using technology. For instance, when an author writes a fraction they define the numerator and denominator. A format that has structural integrity retains the association between these and the fraction to which they belong. 

* [Some formats of document do have structural integrity. This may be because the authoring method enforces it or it may be because the author has followed rules.](http://stemenable.referata.com/wiki/Structural_integrity) 

## Alternative methods of interacting with material

Some examples of inaccessibility are not due to lack of structure but are because the material is presented in a mode that is fundamentally inaccessible to a particular group of readers. For instance, a diagram which does not have an alternative method of accessing the information contained within it.
